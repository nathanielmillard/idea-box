# What is this?
This project is a demonstration of growth, and an exercise in a short sprint react app. Originally in my programming education I build [this app](https://github.com/nathanielmillard/ideabox-boilerplate-trials) with a team of three developers using vanilla javascript in ~2 weeks. My goal is to see how many hours this would take me to build instead as a react app as a solo developer. 

# How?
My goal is to recreate this app with styled components and React with react hooks. I would like to aim for >90% test coverage, and time permitting I may even attempt to build a small scale express serve to replace the local storage functionality. 

# Why?
I am curious to see how dramatically the return of code quality and functionality on investment of time has changed as I have gorwn as a developer and when utilizing a framework like React to handle more modular functionality. 

##Time Tracker:
So far I have spent 2 hour and 45 minutes on this project.
